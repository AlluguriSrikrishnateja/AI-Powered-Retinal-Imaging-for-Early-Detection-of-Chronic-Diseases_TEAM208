However, the main body of the presentation describes a project focused on Pneumonia Prediction by developing a machine learning model to efficiently and accurately predict the disease from chest X-ray images. The project's methodology is centered on using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and deploying it via a MERN stack portal for medical professionals.

## About

This project aims to build a portal to predict pneumonia efficiently and accurately from chest X-ray images by developing a machine learning model. This addresses challenges in traditional diagnosis, such as being time-consuming, having subjectivity in interpretation, and facing resource constraints in many healthcare facilities.

## Features

Focus: Develop a machine learning model to accurately predict pneumonia based on chest X-ray images.


Platform: Build a prediction portal using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).



Goal: Improve the speed and accuracy of diagnosis.


Target Audience: Medical professionals and healthcare institutions.


Model Performance: Achieved an Accuracy of 90%, Precision of 93%, and Recall of 92%



## Requirements

AI Model Development & Implementation

Algorithm: YOLOv7 (for object detection/localization) , Margin-based Embedding Model.



Data: Publicly available dataset of chest X-ray images labeled as "pneumonia" or "normal".


Frameworks/Libraries: PyTorch and OpenCV.


Web App Stack: MERN stack
